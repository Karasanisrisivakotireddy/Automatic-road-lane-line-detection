Lane detection is a challenging problem. Many technical improvements have 
recently been made in the field of road safety, as accidents have been increasing at 
an alarming rate, and one of the major causes of such accidents is a driver's lack of 
attention. To lower the incidence of accidents and keep safe, technological 
breakthroughs should be made. One method is to use Lane Detection Systems, 
which function by recognizing lane borders on the road and alerting the driver if he 
switches to an incorrect lane marking. A lane detection system is an important part 
of many technologically advanced transportation systems.  
sa person encounters, particularly while driving at night or in daytime. A 
camera positioned on the front of the car catches the view of the road and detects 
lane boundaries. The method utilized in this research the video, which is then used 
to recognize the lanes on the road. Several methods for detecting lane markings on 
the road have been presented.
